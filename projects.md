# Project Theme

Projects explored challenges and opportunities in self-tracking, also known as Personal Informatics:

> Personal informatics systems are systems that help people collect personally relevant information for the purpose of 
> self-reflection and gaining self-knowledge.
>
> [Li _et al._, 2010]({{ site.baseurl }}/readings/PersonalInformatics-Li2010.pdf).

Personal informatics relates heavily to the [Quantified Self](http://quantifiedself.com/) movement, which emphasizes:

> Self-knowledge through numbers.
>
> [Gary Wolf, 2009](http://archive.wired.com/medtech/health/magazine/17-07/lbnp_knowthyself)

People have long sought to better understand themselves, but recently technology advances are enabling fundamentally new approaches. 
Students have examined the problems people encounter, then explored how new technology can go beyond the data fetish to help people in reaching their goals.
